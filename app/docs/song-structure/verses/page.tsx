      <p>
        Verses are the storytelling sections of a song. They typically contain the bulk of the song's narrative, imagery, and detail. Here are some key characteristics of verses:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Usually contain different lyrics in each iteration</li>
        <li>Often have a consistent rhyme scheme and meter</li>
        <li>Generally have a lower emotional intensity than the chorus</li>
        <li>Typically lead into the chorus or refrain</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold" id="verse-structure">Verse Structure</h2>
      <p>
        While verse structure can vary, a common format in popular music is:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>4 or 8 lines</li>
        <li>Alternating rhyme scheme (ABAB or ABABCDCD)</li>
        <li>Consistent meter or syllable count per line</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Remember, these are guidelines, not rules. Many great songs break from these conventions.
